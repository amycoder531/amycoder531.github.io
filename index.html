        <p>Today we found an abandoned duck egg. We decided to take it home and hatch it as an experiment. We did some research of temperatures to hatch the egg at. The temperature to hatch an egg is 37.5 degrees Celcius or 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

         <p>Today is officially the first day we have had this duck egg, I'm not sure if it's alive but I have been keeping it under heat and rotating it. I will find the surface temp soon.
